# Git Hooks

This repo contains hooks I use while developing with GIT

---

## Installation

1. Copy a hook to your `.git/hooks` folder
1. Depending on how you downloaded the file, you may have to remove a `.txt`
extension that may have been added by your Browser.
1. Make the file executable `chomd +x ./git/hooks/<HOOK_FILE>`.
1. There may be further configuration instructions in each hook file, so read
through the file before you try it out.
